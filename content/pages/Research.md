          Abstract: Democracy manifests itself in a range of ways and is an
          imperfect, dynamic struggle for collective decision-making. This
          article discusses the multifaceted processes of deliberative
          democratic praxis found in traditional Māori society. Central to
          decision-making in te ao Māori,

          hui provide formal and informal structures for deliberative democracy,
          precedent setting, learning, and transformation through consensus
          making, inclusive debate, and discussion across all levels of society.
          Rather than coercion and voting, rangatira relied on a complex mix of
          customary values and accomplished oratory skills to explore issues in
          family and community meetings and in public assemblies. Decisions made
          through inclusive deliberative processes practiced in hui established
          evident reasoning and responsibility for all community members to
          uphold the reached consensus. This article claims that practicing
          deliberative democracy as a fundamental way of life, learned through
          ongoing active and meaningful participation throughout childhood,
          improves the integrity of democratic decision-making

          Abstract: This comprehensive study explores positive impacts of
          democratic systems enacted within secondary schools on students.
          Responses to democratic practices within schools (including collective
          decision-making, deliberative discussion, diverse ways of being, and
          freedom of movement and expression) are examined and analysed.
          Additionally, the hidden curriculum created by structures and
          processes inherent in democratic participation is critically reflected
          on, including consideration of how democratic processes relate to
          individual and collective well-being within thschool environment.


          The study adopts a qualitative grounded theory research methodology to
          comprehend the outcomes of learning within democratic settings.
          Participants, including alumni and staff from two different democratic
          school environments, share their perspectives through semi-structured
          one-on-one interviews and question-and-answer emails. Data collection
          and analysis were conducted concurrently, and the data analysed using
          constant comparative analysis.


          Democratic building blocks, based on a foundation of respect for the
          student as a whole human, emerged from the data. Organising school
          structures around democratic ideals, reflective of indigenous models
          of democracy, and aligned with Lundy’s model of space, voice,
          influence, and audience aimed at implementing Article 12 of the UNCRC,
          is seen to cultivate a learning environment where diversity is
          embraced and respected. Effective communication skills are honed
          through authentic and meaningful deliberative dialogue, enabling
          students to value diverse perspectives. Alumni valued the challenge of
          navigating agency in a safe supportive learning environment and felt
          empowered to contribute and participate towards a strong collective
          school community.


          Implications from the research underscore the potential of democratic
          systems to create more equitable educational environments, enhancing
          well-being by aligning the hidden curriculum with critical and
          culturally sustainable pedagogies. The study highlights the importance
          of continual dialogue and reflection and advocates for active
          integration of democratic principles within schools to facilitate
          challenges to oppressive structures. It further stresses the need for
          adults to approach schooling from an epistemology of trust in and
          support for the student, enabling genuine equitable dialogue and
          fostering a sense of dignity, significance, and belonging among
          students. Ultimately, the research offers tangible examples of schools
          where student-defined well-being is prioritized and provides a
          forward-thinking approach based on democratic principles to empower
          students.
