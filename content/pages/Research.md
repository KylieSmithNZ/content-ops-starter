          Abstract: Democracy manifests itself in a range of ways and is an
          imperfect, dynamic struggle for collective decision-making. This
          article discusses the multifaceted processes of deliberative
          democratic praxis found in traditional M훮ori society. Central to
          decision-making in te ao M훮ori,

          hui provide formal and informal structures for deliberative democracy,
          precedent setting, learning, and transformation through consensus
          making, inclusive debate, and discussion across all levels of society.
          Rather than coercion and voting, rangatira relied on a complex mix of
          customary values and accomplished oratory skills to explore issues in
          family and community meetings and in public assemblies. Decisions made
          through inclusive deliberative processes practiced in hui established
          evident reasoning and responsibility for all community members to
          uphold the reached consensus. This article claims that practicing
          deliberative democracy as a fundamental way of life, learned through
          ongoing active and meaningful participation throughout childhood,
          improves the integrity of democratic decision-making
